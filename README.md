# ESPHOME Visonic Bridge Configuration

## Introduction
ESPHOME configuration (yaml) to bridge the UART communication between a Powerlink Hardware module (2.0, 3.0 or 3.1) and a Visonic Panel. Henceforth just called Powerlink and Panel respectivelly.

The configuration includes a wifi connection for home automation to support, for example, the Home Assistant Integration.

I have an ESP32 microcontroller board acting as a bridge between the Powerlink and the Panel. It "splits" the RS232 communication between Powerlink and Panel, meaning that both communicate directly with the ESP32.

I have created a prototype ESPHOME config file for it that I'm testing. I have taken the decision to make it available now whilst I'm alpha testing so there's no guarantees that it works at the moment, I'm still testing when I get the time.  But if you can set it up and test that would be brilliant too, let me know of your progress and any issues.

### Setting it up and what you need
What you will need:
- An ESP32 hardware device, cost is around Â£10 each including delivery
- A PC / Laptop (maybe iMac) with ESPHOME on it and a USB connection to the ESP32 device to power it
- Some dupont wires and connector blocks
- A screwdriver (for the connector block) and some wire cutters

Eventually for production to set up the ESP32, it will need to be powered by 3.3v DC.  I anticipate using something like this voltage regulator but this is not needed yet. A step up / step down regulator like [this](https://thepihut.com/products/pololu-3-3v-step-up-step-down-voltage-regulator-s7v8f3?variant=41660290236611) to get the 3.3v for the ESP32, but this is not needed yet as the ESP32 can be powered from the USB connection.

You also need to have a working ESPHOME system set up, see [here](https://esphome.io/) and be able to connect the ESP32 to the USB of the PC and install the config yaml.

The ESPHOME log can be used to see the debug print as the messages are send back and forth between the Powerlink and the Panel.

### PowerMax Panels
I have only tried it once on my main panel and it seemed to work.

PowerMax panels (at least my PowerMax Pro Part) seem fixed at 9600 baud and so don't suffer the problem below for PowerMaster panels.

### PowerMaster Panels
PowerMaster Panels automatically change baud rate between 9600 and 38400. The problem I'm currently working on is centred around that fact that the Powerlink and Panel automatically negotiate the baud rate between 9600 and 38400. My ESPHOME yaml file has to support this negotiation and change the baud of the 2 UART connections (from ESP32 to the powerlink and the panel).  That's why it looks so complex.

It does this by counting communication errors and when a threshold is hit then it changes baud.  It also looks for the message that the powerlink module sends to the panel to change baud, and then changes the baud of both UARTs on the ESP32.

## Connectivity/Wiring Diagram
For development purposes, using either a PC/Laptop or a USB mains plug to power the ESP32 hardware device.

For final installation use either a USB mains plug as above or use a step up / step down DC to DC convertor as per this diagram.

Note that I have not yet done any power / current calculations for this setup.

## Configuration
Download the yaml file and use it to configure an ESP32 hardware microcontroller using ESPHOME.

In your secrets file you need to include the following:

```
wifi_ssid: "yourwifissid"
wifi_password: "yourwifipassword"
visonic_bridge_network_ip: A.B.C.D
network_port: PORT
network_mask: 255.255.255.0
network_gateway: A.B.C.1
# go here to create a random key https://esphome.io/components/api.html
visonic_bridge_esphome_encrypt: RANDOMKEY
```

You will also need to set the values at the top of the yaml file to suit your setup

```
  RX_FROM_PANEL_TX: "19"      # ;    // This is Rx, connect this pin to the Tx on the Panel
  TX_TO_PANEL_RX: "21"        # ;    // This is Tx, connect this pin to the Rx on the Panel
  RX_FROM_POWERLINK_TX: "16"  # ;    // This is Rx, connect this pin to the Tx on the Powerlink 3.1 Hardware Module
  TX_TO_POWERLINK_RX: "17"    # ;    // This is Tx, connect this pin to the Rx on the Powerlink 3.1 Hardware Module
  LED_BUILTIN: GPIO2
  MY_BOARD: "esp32doit-devkit-v1"
```
